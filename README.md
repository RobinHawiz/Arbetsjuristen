# Arbetsjuristen

A website created for a fictional swedish law firm called Arbetsjuristen. The law firm represent both employers and employees in all areas of **labor law**.

## Design

I created a high fidelity wireframe in Figma. The design is based off of the market researh that I did by checking competitors websites and by figuring out who the target audience might be.

The text used within the website does to some extent represent real information regarding swedish labour law, but should not be taken seriously or be taken as legal advice because I'm not a lawyer and therefore cant verify the written content.

All images that are used in the website have been downloaded from [Unsplash](https://www.google.com). All icons that are used are from [iconmonstr](https://iconmonstr.com).

The people used to represent as the face of the company are fictional.
